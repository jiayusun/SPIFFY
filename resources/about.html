</h2>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The Simple Medical Imaging
Library Interface (SMILI), pronounced 'smilie', is a small (application
and) library that provides a very high level (user) interface to some
powerful image processing and scientific visualisation algorithms from
the suberb <a href="http://www.itk.org/">Insight Toolkit</a> and
powerful <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">Visualisation Toolkit</a>. It's
main capability to the interaction of images and 3D models by allowing
simultaneuous visualisation of both in a standardised way and/or
together in a single view.<br>
<br>
SMILI was developed by Dr. Shekhar S. Chandra in his spare time during
his
post doctoral fellowship at the Australian e-Health Research Centre,
CSIRO and Research Fellowship at the University of Queensland from 2011
to
2014 under the expert supervision of Dr. Jurgen Fripp, Dr. Jason
Dowling, Dr. Olivier Salvado and Prof. Stuart Crozier. It is in some
way a spiritual successor to the <a
 href="http://qcplusplus.sourceforge.net/">Discrete Geometry
3D Viewer (DGV)</a> he developed in his Ph.D. <br>
<br>
It was born out of the
necessity of having a easy to use but light
weight (in terms of processing) library to develop user interface
applications that everyday researcher could leverage to make their work
more readily accessible to others. The prototype viewer, called sMILX,
was developed that soon grew to be the defacto application for medical
imaging and shape analysis within our lab.<br>
<br>
With its main application sMILX, you can load a number of formats,
visualise and process multi-dimensional images and models with simple
right-clicks and see the results immediately (ignoring algorithm
processing times) then save the result. The file formats supported
include (but not limited to) the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Nifti (*.nii.gz *.nii) and GIPL (*.gipl)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Analyse (*.img *hdr)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Raster multimedia formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, PPM.<br>
  </li>
  <li>DICOMs of various descriptions (*.ima *.dcm *.dicom). Support is
done via the GDCM library. See <a
 href="http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">here</a>
for more information.</li>
  <li>VTK XML Image (*.vti)</li>
  <li>Triangulated Surfaces or 3D Models (*.vtp *.vtk *.ply *.obj *.stl)</li>
  <li>Meta Images (*.mha *.mhd)</li>
  <li>Delimited Text or Comma Separated Value files (*.txt *.csv). This
is mainly for plots.</li>
  <li>Other formats that can be supported include (PGM, INR) with the
appropriate plugins.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The different type of visualisations supported include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>n-D Image Volumes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>3D Image Volumes</li>
    <li>Vector Images such as deformation fields</li>
    <li>Diffusion images</li>
    <li>Annotation (distances, angles etc.)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>3D Models</li>

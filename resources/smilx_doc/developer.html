<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">sMILX has a very simple and
lightweight Application Programming Interface (API) and plugin system,
which are both easy to use and extend.<br>

<h2>Extending sMILX</h2>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

sMILX can be extended using separately licensed and distributed custom
plugins. The plugins can be classed into three types and their
combinations (ordered by the amount of work required to setup):<br>

<ol>

  <li>An extension - a very simple plugin which implements just a few
features accessible from the right click menu. The features are
implemented as overloaded or new members of sub-classed versions of the
milxQtImage or milxQtModel classes. The denoise plugin is an example of
this type.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A docked window - a plugin which had docked display. The Python
plugin is an example of this type.<br>
  </li>
  <li>An integrated plugin - a plugin which provides file I/O support
and a new display window typically by sub-classing milxQtRenderWindow.
The shape model plugin is an example of this type.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

The plugins are sub-classes of the milxQtPluginInterface class. sMILX
loads all shared object files (or dynamic libraries) as
milxQtPluginInterface objects found in the 'plugins' folder. Therefore,
your plugin simply needs to 'look' like this class. This is achieved by
sub-classing milxQtPluginInterface and ensuring all members are
defined, but not necessarily implemented. Then its just a case of
having a consistent name for the class, setting the Boolean flags to
tell sMILX what the plugin has available and subclassing either
milxQtModel or milxQtImage. The next section illustrates this
proceedure by creating a Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) extension.<br>

<h4>Adding a new extension for sMILX</h4>

The fastest way to setup an extension is to modify some existing code.
You can modify the denoise plugin (found in plugin/deNoise), use the <a href="qrc:/resources/smilx_doc/plugin_guide.html">plugin guide</a> or the
plugin interface class directly to ensure getting the latest and most
well documented interface. In all cases, try supplementing your method
with the following:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Create a directory called 'dti' (or the name of your plugin) in
the 'plugin' directory, copy the milxQtPluginInterface and rename it to
'milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin' or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Open the file in you favourite editor and find/replace
'PluginInterface' with 'DiffusionTensorPlugin'. You may want to deal
with the guard block separately ensuring the use of capitals. Make sure
to add the include for milxQtPluginInterface
and remove the empty constructor and destructor (including the QThread
reference) with milxQtPluginInterface.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change the sub-classing to inherit from
milxQtPluginInterface,
something like changing from 'milxQtPluginInterface : public QThread'
to 'milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin : public milxQtPluginInterface'. Also,
remove the '= 0' of all members except the ones in the 'public slots',
which can be replaced with empty {}. Lastly, remove all the non-virtual
members, signals and the private members as they are inheritted now.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Change the plugin factory code near the bottom of the header to
something like (ensuring the removal of the Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE line):<br>
    <pre>class MILXQT_PLUGIN_EXPORT milxQtDiffusionTensorPluginFactory: public QObject,<br>public milxQtPluginFactory<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q_OBJECT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q_INTERFACES(milxQtPluginFactory)<br>public:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; milxQtPluginInterface* newPlugin(QObject *theParent = 0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp; return new milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin(theParent);&nbsp; }<br>};<br></pre>
Only two places required changing the 'DeNoise' string with
DiffusionTensor. That concludes the header changes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Copy the CMakeLists.txt from the denoise plugin and replace
'deNoise' with 'DTI' or equivalent. Remember that the plugin header and
source files are called 'milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin'.
The name is important here as it must match the name you will give
later in the plugin source file. Remove references to other headers and
source files, you will eventually add your own here. We can also remove
the VTK or ITK references here until we need them later. However, Qt
references are required so don't remove them.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, we need the plugin source file. You can copy and modify
the denoise version or create your own. The former is less error prone
and when doing the latter ensure that all virtual members are
implemented even if their stubs. To modify the denoise source, rename
and find/replace as we did before for the header file. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that the export plugin (last) line looks like:<br>
    <pre>Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2(DTIPlugin, milxQtDiffusionTensorPluginFactory);<br></pre>
Notice that the first argument is the same name as the plugin in the
CMakeLists.txt file. The second argument is the plugin factory class
found in the header. For the moment, we will comment out the
'createConnections', 'run()' and 'milxQtDeNoisePlugin::pluginWindow'
members fully, and comment the code inside the constructor,
'modelResult()' member, 'isPluginWindow()' member and the
'milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin::loadExtension()' member.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all virtual members have an implementation in either
the source file or the header file. You may need to copy some inline
implementations from the denoise plugin header file too, such as
the'hasOpenSupport()' member etc. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, add the build sub-directory directive in the plugin
CMakeLists.txt file as<br>
    <pre>if(BUILD_DTI_PLUGIN)<br>    add_subdirectory(dti)<br>endif(BUILD_DTI_PLUGIN)<br></pre>
Enable the option in the SMILI CMakeLists.txt file as<br>
    <pre>OPTION(BUILD_DTI_PLUGIN "Build the Diffusion Tensor plugin for MILX Qt Viewer" OFF)<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>The plugin should now compile and build. The plugin will be
loaded by sMILX upon startup. It should output something like the
following in the Log window:<br>
    <pre>Attempting to Load libDTIPlugin.so<br>Instanced ...</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Now simply sub-class milxQtImage and/or milxQtModel and implement
functions commented in step 7 as in the denoise plugin to complete your
plugin.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<ul>

  <li>I get the "milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin.h:277: Error: Undefined
interface" build error - You forgot the include for
milxQtPluginInterface in the header file (see step 2 above).</li>
  <li>I got the "error: cannot allocate an object of abstract type
&#8216;milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin' ... because the following virtual
functions are pure within &#8216;milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin&#8217; - You forgot to
remove the '= 0' of all members in the plugin header except the ones in
the 'public slots', which can be replaced with empty {} (see step 3
above).</li>
  <li>I got the "Attempting to Load libDTIPlugin.so... Failed to load
plugin: Cannot load library
/home/shakes/smili/build/plugins/libDTIPlugin.so:
(/home/shakes/smili/build/plugins/libDTIPlugin.so: undefined symbol:
_ZN27milxQtDiffusionTensorPlugin14hasOpenSupportEv)" - Turned out that
I forgot to implement one of the virtual functions in the plugin class,
'hasOpenSupport' is this case (see step 8).<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>API</h3>

sMILX
has two lightweight API layers, one for GUI-independent functions and
one for GUI-dependent functions. The GUI-independent layer is called
SMILI and the GUI-dependent is called milxQt. To build into sMILX a new
functionality, you can follow the following example:<br>

<h4>Adding a new model/surface processing filter</h4>

In
this example, we will add the functionality in the milxQtModel class
(this handles the surface/model display) that colours the surface
points based on their point IDs.
<ol>

  <li>Add the relevant member to the SMILI milx::Model class.
In this case, since the new member is vertex based we place the new
member close to the GenerateVertices() member. We copy and paste this
member, call it GenerateVertexScalars() and change the
vtkVertexGlyphFilter to the vtkIdFilter and add the
SetIdsArrayName("Point IDs") and&nbsp;PointIdsOn() lines too. Then
change the line for updating the model state with either
UpdateModelState() or UpdateModelStateFromModel depending on the filter.</li>
  <li>We add the include for vtkIdFilter in the source file and the
member prototype definition in the milx::Model header file
underneath&nbsp;GenerateVertices().
We also amend the documentation to "Generate vertex scalars for display
from point data. This colours the mesh by point ids."</li>
  <li>Build to test the changes. If successful, this functionality is
now available to be called from all non-GUI related applications.</li>
  <li>Next
we add the necessary hooks to use the filter in the sMILX GUI by
appending a member in milxQtModel. Add the action for the new filter,
in this case we add the genPointIDsAct action underneath genLabelsAct
and duplicate the relevant entries in createActions(),
createConnections() and in generationMenu() or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Lastly, we clone the generateLabels() in milxQtModel
and change the name to generatePointIDsScalars() or equivalent. We then
add the entry
model.GenerateVertexScalars() and replace the generate labels code.
This new member will actually look more like generateTensorField()
member. Make sure to update the header file also and ensure the connect
line in createConnections() matches the name of the new member
otherwise your context menu entry will not call the member when clicked.</li>
  <li>Build and if successful, the context menu entry will be available
in the Generate menu.</li>
</ol>
